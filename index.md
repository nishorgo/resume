## THESIS
---

### Automatic Bangla Image Captioning using Transformer Network
* A CNN-Transformer model to generate captions for the BanglaLekhaImageCaptions dataset.
* The images are fed into the pre-trained ResNet-101 model to extract images and send them into the encoder part.
* The training captions are sent to the decoder part of the Transformer network.
* The network uses self-attention mechanism to understand the underlying relationship between the images and their captions to generate automatic captions.
